### Support for:
* Bulk domain searching
* No 3rd party API used (meaning infinite calls)
* Search mutliple TLDs at a time (e.g. `.com`, `.de`, `.fr` etc)

### How to use
1. Make sure you have NodeJS and `yarn` installed.
2. Place a list of all the domains you want to check in the `dict.txt` file (Make a new line for each domain)
3. Use `yarn start` and wait for the process to complete (the more domains to check, the longer it will take)
